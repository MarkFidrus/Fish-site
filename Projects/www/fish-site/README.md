# Fish site documentation
Hello <span style="color: orange;">visitor!</span> I'm <span style="color: green;">Mark</span> a beginner web developer. I would like to learn the Laravel framework, so this is my first laravel project for my practice.
Contrary to its name, this is a gallery creation and photo uploading site. The name of the site was selected randomly, when I was looking for icons for menu items on [fontawesome](https://google.com). The first not average icon was a fish icon, so the fish icon became to the logo and the ***fish site*** became its name.
